# Leetcode

This repository contains the solutions to the problems I worked on during my Google interview preparation.

I completed the first 155 problems in a row, and then I went more by topics, searching for the most upvoted problems on various categories.

If you have suggestions or you find some bug/error, please feel free to contact me or to make a pull request.
